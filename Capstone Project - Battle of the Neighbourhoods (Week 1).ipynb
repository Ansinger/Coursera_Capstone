    "The audience for this analysis will be the DOHMH (New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene). The DOHMH has very limited inspection capacity (while resturants in New York are plentiful). The DOHMH wants to understand what the primary elements are that predict critical food violations/low inspection grades. This understanding would allow them to focus their inspections on those restaurants where the likelihood for food violations is highest. The DOHMH would also like to understand where the data can be meaningfully clustered. \n",
